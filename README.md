# Solarized Colorscheme for Notepad++
This is a [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color scheme for [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) 
([GitHub page](https://github.com/walesmd/notepad-plus-plus-solarized)) by [Michael Wales](http://github.com/walesmd/).

See the [Solarized website](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) or [GitHub page](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) 
for versions of this color scheme for other editors, terminals and other applications.


## Installation
Use one of the methods below:

-   Move the `.xml` files to `%PROGRAMFILES%\Notepad++\themes\` and select Solarized (Dark/Light) within the Style 
    Configurator in Notepad++. This directory may already have out-dated versions of Solarized that should be deleted, 
    named `Solarized.xml` and `Solarized-light.xml`
    
-   or, rename this file to styler.xml, then move & replace to %APPDATA%\Notepad++\stylers.xml
